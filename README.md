##Submitting Pull Requests and Issues
**Please Please Please** Submit any bugs or any fixes you would like fixed about the app. 
Since I do professional development, and personal web development projects,
I dont have as much time as I used to for my android apps,
So any help finding and squashing bugs is appreciated :)

##Starting the App:
Clone the repo, run both '`npm install` and `bower install`.Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
